## XYM

XYM is the base-layer currency of Symbol. Any activity on the blockchain - from recording data to sending assets or messages - requires a small fee of XYM, which rewards validators who create and finalize blocks.

### Tutorial: Querying XYM Supply
Maximum supply is the maximum number of XYM that can ever be minted.
```sh
curl https://${SYMBOL_API_NODE}:3001/network/currency/supply/max
```
```py
async def get_maximum_supply():
	async with ClientSession() as session:
		async with session.get(f'{SYMBOL_API_ENDPOINT}/network/currency/supply/max') as response:
			maximum_supply = float(await response.text())
			print(f'maximum supply: {maximum_supply:.6f}')
```

Total supply is the number of XYM minted to date.
```sh
curl https://${SYMBOL_API_NODE}:3001/network/currency/supply/total
```
```py
async def get_total_supply():
	async with ClientSession() as session:
		async with session.get(f'{SYMBOL_API_ENDPOINT}/network/currency/supply/total') as response:
			total_supply = float(await response.text())
			print(f'total supply: {total_supply:.6f}')
```

Circulating supply is the number of XYM minted to date, excluding the balances of the two fee sinks:
1. VORTEX4: Mosaic and namespace rental fee sink
2. VORTEX3: Network fee sink

```sh
curl https://${SYMBOL_API_NODE}:3001/network/currency/supply/circulating
```
```py
async def get_circulating_supply():
	async with ClientSession() as session:
		async with session.get(f'{SYMBOL_API_ENDPOINT}/network/currency/supply/circulating') as response:
			circulating_supply = float(await response.text())
			print(f'circulating supply: {circulating_supply:.6f}')
```
